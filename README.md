# ELF_plays
This repository holds scripts and files which will allow to analyze play by play data for European League of Football (ELF).

It currently holds two scripts:<br>
	1. First is for scrapping play by play information for European League of Football games (on a game by game basis) from the official ELF site.<br>
	2. Second script for rework of scrapped information. This script takes data from the file created by previous one (14 original columns) and based on information in it creates additional collumns with data (mid-August 2020 over 45 columns in total)
  
It also contains additional none code files:<br>
	1. Txt file which contains explanaitions for all columns<br>
	2. Xlsx file updated weekly during the season (one file for one season) that has all the data scraped and saved in the final version with all available columns.
    
In the future both code and files are going to be updated with more columns with additional information.
