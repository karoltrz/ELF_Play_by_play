# ELF_plays 
Note - due to incomplete data on official ELF page project on hold. 
If in 2023 season play by play data will be updated correctly project will be restarted.

This repository holds scripts and files which will allow to analyze play by play data for European League of Football (ELF).

It currently holds 3 scripts:<br>
	1. First is for scrapping play by play information for European League of Football games (on a game by game basis) from the official ELF site.<br>
	2. Second is for scrapping general schedule information for European League of Football games (on a game by game basis) from the official ELF site.<br>
	2. Third script for rework of scrapped information from previous two scripts. This script takes data from the files created by previous ones and based on information in it creates additional columns with data (August 2020 - 74 columns in total)
  
It also contains additional none code files:<br>
	1. Txt file which contains general descriptions for all columns<br>
	2. Xlsx files updated weekly during the season (one file for one season with play by play data and second one with season schedule) that has all the data scraped and saved in the final version with all available columns.
    
In the future code and other files are going to be updated with more columns containing additional information.
